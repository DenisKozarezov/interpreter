## Introduction

> [!WARNING]
> This repository is a pet project and is purely for academic interest. The scripting language being developed
> here (the so-called **guest language**) is not a real programming language. The goals of the project are
> to study the topic of text recognition and its subsequent lexing, parsing and execution of an abstract
> syntax tree (AST).

> [!NOTE]
